# local unID toolbox

Matlab toolbox for the estimation of the local Information Decomposition terms in the univariate framework. 
Specifically, the measures of entropy, dynamic entropy, conditional entropy and information storage can be obtained by using the local estimation approach and the continuous estimation strategies of linear parametric and nearest neighbor.
